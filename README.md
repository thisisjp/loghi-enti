# What is this about?
We're tidying up the library of italian public entities logos, by merging the ones originally uplodaded using "Area Riservata" with the ones provided by entities who provide services on the IO app. 

# Why are we doing this?
While the former have tipically with a low resolution and bad quality, the latter have a better size and resolution, although a manual check from PagoPA's design team is needed.

# What are the quality criteria?
- The logo must have a 1:1 ratio
- The logo must have a white background
- The logo must be printable in 600dpi at 1.5×1.5cm, meaning at leat 354×354px
- The logo must be centred (vertically and horizontally) and use the whole available area

# How does the selection process work?
1. The main folder contains the logos uploaded by entities on Area Riservata
2. The PRs will contain the logos uploaded by entities using IO app via the FKA "Developer Portal"
3. Designers have to check whether to keep the main logo (Area Riservata version) or replace it with the new one (IO version)
4. The resulting logos will be screened against the quality criteria and a final report will be delivered
